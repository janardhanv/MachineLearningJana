Naive Bayes algorithm is simple 

In Naive Bayes if the conditional independence assumption actually holds, the classifier will converge quicker than discriminative models like logistic regression, 
so you need less training data. (Even if the naive assumption does not hold good the training time is less)


Naive Bayes works best when you have small training data set, relatively small features(dimensions). 
If you have huge feature list, the model may not give you accuracy, because the likelihood would be distributed and may not follow the Gaussian or other distribution. 

Another condition for Naive Bayes to work is that features should be independent of each other - if you understand the domain, then try to analyze 
how each features are related to each other, are they affecting the each others likelihood. if not Naive Bayes can give you good result.
